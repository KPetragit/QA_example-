**Overview**

<details>
  <summary>Sample completion</summary>
  <p>Sample completion is calculated as the percentage of completed interviews out of the total sample size (4,050).</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Complete interviews</summary>
  <p>
    A complete interview—or one that does not trigger replacement—is defined as an interview in which the correct protocol (three contact attempts) has been followed for all eligible respondents (excluding the head of household), and at least the head of household and one randomly selected adult have been interviewed.<br><br>
    Eligible respondents include:<br>
    1. Head of household<br>
    2. Randomly selected adult<br>
    3. Randomly selected woman<br>
    4. Randomly selected child and caregiver<br>
    5. Mobile household member

  <summary>Sample completion by stratum</summary>
  <p>Sample completion by stratum plus the total sample completion.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Complete interviews by stratum</summary>
  <p>Displays progress of complete interviews in each stratum.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Sample completion Meheba and Mayukwayukwa</summary>
  <p>Displays the sample completion for stratums Meheba settlements and Mayukwayukwa settlements. Despite registration in settlements, a number of refugees reside informally outside settlements. This results in split households where some members remain in settlement while others reside permanently or semi-permanently outside. As such, within the population of households registered in Meheba and Mayukwayukwa, FDS will distinguish households with mobile members from those without mobile members.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Expected duration</summary>
  <p>Shows expected duration of the data collection by stratum, Based on assumptions for the number of interviews per day, the chart shows a date range for the expected completion of data collection.</p>

**Outcome**

<details>
  <summary>Eligible units</summary>
  <p>
    An eligible unit is a sample household that meets the survey’s eligibility criteria.<br><br>
    - For refugee or asylum seeker households: the household head or spouse must be a registered refugee in the geographic stratum from which the household was sampled.<br>
    - For former refugee households: the head or spouse must be a former refugee registered with the Commission for Refugees in the relevant stratum.<br>
    - Host community households are considered eligible if they reside in the geographic stratum and neither the head nor the spouse is a refugee or former refugee.

  <summary>Replacement need</summary>
  <p> The replacement need reflects the proportion of interviews that need to be replaced. In Meheba and Mayukwayukwa top-up sampling is used due to the inability to classify households in the footprint frame a-priori. Therefore, replacement procedures were not implemented in the Meheba and Mayukwayukwa strata, interviews from these locations are excluded from the calculation. </p>
